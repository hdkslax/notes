### What is Computing Science?

###### **CS** is **problem solving**

`Algorithms` - 模板, a way of thinking, a list of steps to follow to complete a task!

`Programming / Code` - 将模板变成现实, a way of communicating

`Programming` is the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of basic constructs, including: input, output, conditions (rules), repetition, math or logic. 

* 编程就是 大事化小小事化了。



###### Python is interpreted

`python`是一门**解释性语言**(interpreted)

`source code` -> `Interpreter` -> `output`

`C, C++, Java, ...` 都是**编译型语言**(compiled)

`source code` -> `compiler` -> `Object code` -> `Executor` -> `Output`



### Under the Hood

```python
print("""Hello
	human""")

print(type("beep"))
print(type("5"))
print(type(5))

print("Take", "5")
print("Take 5")
print(555, 555)
```



###### Bits and Bytes

**bits** - 0, 1

* digital computers are machines that convert high and low electrical signals into 0’s and 1’s.
* The lowest level of communication with a digital computer is 0’s and 1’s.

**bytes** 

* 1 byte = 8 bits

<img src="img/5.png" />

<img src="img/6.png" />

例题：

Represent Binary Number 01001010 in Decimal number.

0 * 128 + 1 * 64 + 0 * 32 + 0 * 16 + 1 * 8 + 0 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 1 = 74

What is the maximum number representable with 8 bits?

255

###### ASCII table

<img src="img/7.png" />

###### Binary to ASCII

<img src="img/8.png" />

Binary -> Decimal -> char



###### ASCII to Binary

Hello World!

ASCII -> Decimal -> Binary

###### Hexadecimal 

0~9, A, B, C, D, E, F

A = 10

B = 11

十六进制，常用于表示颜色

例如：0x66ccff 天依蓝



###### Unicode

为了表示英文字母之外的其他字符，比如：中文汉字

每个字符占4 bytes

###### Mojibake

when characters are encoded one way, but decoded a different way.



###### Space

1 TB = 1000 GB				TB = terabyte	GB = gigabyte

1 GB = 1000 MB				MB = megabyte

1 MB = 1000 kB				kB = kilobyte

1 kB = 1000 B					B = byte



### Chatbots with Personality

###### Algorithm

Algorithm = 算法 = 特定计算模型下，旨在解决特定问题的指令序列

* 输入 - 待处理的信息（问题）
* 输出 - 经处理的信息（答案）
* 正确性 - 的确可以解决指定的问题
* 确定性 - 任一算法都可以描述为一个由基本操作组成的序列
* 可行性 - 每一基本操作都可以实现，且在常数时间内完成
* 有穷性 - 对于任何输入，经有穷次基本操作，都可以得到输出 （程序 ≠ 算法）



###### Comments in Python

```python
# comments here
```



###### Four elements on the top of a Python file

* **title** of your program
* **Author** name
* **date** of creating
* professor **description** of your program

```python
# Greetings Chatbot
# Author: xxx
# Date: Jan. 24, 2021
# desciption: 

# Say hi, what's your name?
# Get the user's name 
# Respond nice to meet you, <name>
# Ask what your favourite book is
# let user respond
# Make a comment about it
```

###### Input, output, assign a value to a variable

* input

  ```python
  input()
  # or
  input("Hi, what's your name?")
  ```

* output

  ```python
  print("Hi, what's your name?")
  print("Nice to meet you, " + user)
  ```

* assign a value to a variable

  ```python
  user = input()
  ```

* The whole program like this:

  ```python
  # Greetings Chatbot
  # Author: XXX
  # Date: Jan. 24, 2021
  
  # Say hi, what's your name?
  print("Hi, what's your name?")
  
  # Get the user's name 
  user = input()
  
  # Respond nice to meet you, <name>
  print("Nice to meet you, " + user)
  
  # Ask what your favourite book is
  print("What is your favourite book?")
  
  # let user respond
  input()
  
  # Make a comment about it
  print("Oh, nice!")
  ```

  or

  ```python
  # Greetings Chatbot
  # Author: XXX
  # Date: Jan. 24, 2021
  
  # Say hi, what's your name?
  # Get the user's name 
  user = input("Hi, what's your name?") # 这个输入的值接下来要用到，所以需要保存在一个变量里
  
  # Respond nice to meet you, <name>
  print("Nice to meet you, " + user)
  
  # Ask what your favourite book is
  # let user respond
  input("What is your favourite book?") # 这个输入值接下来不再会被用到，所以不需要用变量来保存它
  
  # Make a comment about it
  print("Oh, nice!")
  ```

###### variables

can:

* can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
* should start with a letter (lowercase)

cannot:

* can’t contain space or symbols
* can’t be one of the reserved keywords

| Reserved KEYWORDS: |       |        |          |        |          |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------ | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| and                | as    | assert | break    | class  | continue |
| def                | del   | elif   | else     | except | exec     |
| finally            | for   | from   | global   | if     | import   |
| in                 | is    | lambda | nonlocal | not    | or       |
| pass               | raise | return | try      | while  | with     |
| yield              | True  | False  | None     |        |          |

eg. my_program

###### List 列表

list is to enclose the elements in square brackets ( `[` and `]`)

```python
[10, 20, 30, 40]
```



the elements of a list don’t have to be the same type

```python
["hello", 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]
```



Update your algorithm using list: 

```python
# Greetings Chatbot
# Author: XXX
# Date: Jan. 24, 2021

import random

# Say hi, what's your name?
# Get the user's name 
user = input("Hi, what's your name?") # 这个输入的值接下来要用到，所以需要保存在一个变量里

# Respond nice to meet you, <name>
print("Nice to meet you, " + user)

# Ask what your favourite book is
# let user respond
input("What is your favourite book?") # 这个输入值接下来不再会被用到，所以不需要用变量来保存它

# Make a comment about it that is not too repetitive
# Have a list of possible comments 
comments = ["Oh, nice!", "That's a good one.", "Hmm, strange taste.", "blah, blah, blah", "Whoa there.", "Hahahahaha!"]

# Choose one randomly from the list
random_comment = random.choice(comments)

# Say that random comment
print(random_comment)
```



###### Branching

```python
if <condition>:
	...
elif <condition>:  # optional
	...
else: # optional
	...
```



例：

```python
# How's it Going Bot
# Author: XXX
# Date: Jan. 24, 2021

# Description: This bot will ask you how it's going and make a comment depending on how you answered

# Ask user how it's going 
print("How's it going?")

# Get the user's reply
reply = input()

# If they said Good, then reply Good!
if reply == "Good":
    print("Good!")

# Otherwise, if they they said Bad, then reply Oh no!
elif reply == "Bad":
    print("Oh no!")

# In call other cases, reply "I see..."
else:
	print("I see...")
```



Update version:

```python
# How's it Going Bot
# Author: XXX
# Date: Jan. 24, 2021

# Description: This bot will ask you how it's going and make a comment depending on how you answered

# Ask user how it's going 
print("How's it going?")

# Get the user's reply
reply = input()

# If they said Good, then reply Good!
if reply == "Good" or reply == "good" or reply == "great" or reply == "Great":
    print("Good!")

# Otherwise, if they they said Bad, then reply Oh no!
elif reply == "Bad":
    print("Oh no!")

# In call other cases, reply "I see..."
else:
	print("I see...")
```



###### Boolean

Boolean expression can be either **True** or **False**

例： `reply == "good"`

注意：`==` 和 `=` 不一样！`==` 表示相等， `=` 表示赋值

例：

```python
# Boolean Examples
# Author: XXX
# Date: Jan. 24, 2021

# Setting a variable to the inter 
num = 10

# Print out some boolean examples
print(num == 10)
print(num == 20)
print(num != 10)
print(num != 20)
print(num >= 10)
print(num < 10)
print(num > 10 or num < 10)
print(num > 10 and num == 10)
```

* **Efficiency**

###### Code reviews

* Am I able to **understand** the code easily?
* Is the code following **Coding Standards / Guidelines**?
* Can I **test or Debug** the code easily? e.g. add comments
* Is the code **duplicated** more than twice?

###### How to name your file?

Avoid spaces in your file name. 

eg, **myprgram.py** or **my_program.py** but not **my program.py**



###### Problem solving

* Design your algorithm using a concrete example.
* Break down a large problem into smaller parts.

例：

```python
# Fortune Cookie Generator
# Author: XXX
# Date: Jan. 24, 2021
# Generates a random fortune

import random

# Create a list
fortunes = ["have great success.", "find love.", "become rich."]

# Select random
random_fortune = random.choice(fortunes)

# Output
print("You will " + random_fortune)
```

```python
# CoffeeBOt
# Author: XXX
# Date: Jan. 24, 2021

# Asks if you want cream or not (Yes / No)
print("I'm CoffeeBot. Would you like cream with your coffee? (Yes / No)")

# get input
response = input()

# If you want cream, say here's your coffee with cream
if response == "yes" or response == "Yes":
    print("Here's your coffee with cream.")
    
# Otherwise if they say no, say here's your coffee no cream
elif response == "no" or response == "No":
    print("Here's your coffee, no cream.")

# In all other cases, say I don't know what ___ means
else:
    print("Sorry, I don't know what " + reponse + " means.")
```
