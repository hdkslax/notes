## Audio Signals

### What is Sound?

* Sound is a wave phenomenon, involving molecules of air being compressed and expanded under the action of some physical device.
  * A speaker (or other sound generator) vibrates back and forth and produces a *longitudinal* pressure wave that perceived as sound.
  * Since sound is a pressure wave, it takes on continuous values, as opposed to digitized ones.
    * If we wish to use a digital version of sound waves, we must form digitized representations of audio information.

### Sound Recording and Reproducing

* Thomas Edison's Phonograph 1877 
  * first device to record and reproduce sound
  * Medium: a tinfoil sheet phonograph cylinder.
* Alexander Graham Bell's improvement in 1880s
